    "### Business Context\n",
    "Insurance companies process large volumes of claims, but only a small fraction can be investigated for potential fraud due to limited Special Investigations Unit (SIU) capacity. Fraudulent claims increase loss ratios and operating costs, while excessive investigations can harm customer trust and increase expenses.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Objective\n",
    "Using information available at claim time, build an interpretable fraud risk scoring model that helps prioritize claims for investigation. The model should support decision-making under capacity constraints rather than aiming to label claims as definitively fraudulent.\n"
